Assignment 2
Partner: David Bacon (second class section), Patrick Fuller (second class section)

According to my program. I got my C files translated to C++ and got my program
to parse through the end of each test files. I spent plenty of time figuring 
out the checks and do statements in my cases of the parse file. I got that 
part to work and it my program successfully reaches the end of file. I place
exception handlers for the exception syntax recovery in case if the file has 
an unexpected syntax input the parser will parse through the next token to recover from the error until there is a valid token or the parser reaches the end
 of file. The program either uses the syntax error recovery implementation to 
parse through the file or it displays a correct syntax tree. Also I got the 
syntax tree to print but the format looks kind of fuzzy. I did the best I 
could in trying to print a perfect syntax tree.

I worked with David Bacon and Patrick Fuller with this assignment. They are 
both in the second class section of the OPL course.
